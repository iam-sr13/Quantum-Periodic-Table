QPT is nothing but a Quantised version of the modern periodic table 
along with it's counter part the anti-periodic table 
(i.e a periodic table of anti-matter elements). Quantised in the sense
that every element can be grouped in its certain orbital packet 
(s1,s2,p1,p2...or in case of anti we have alpha1,alpha2,beta1....etc). 
This packets are named by the orbital name which is largest in its packet. 
Each packet comes with two versions for e.g d1 and d2. This table has
a unique incremental pattern, which can be computer generated till infinity. 
The idea behind this project is to recognise this hidden pattern in this
elements of our nature and try to extract the information encrypted in this pattern.
Some of the names like(alpha, beta orbitals) are not IUPAC and are used only to
complete this project. 
This project is my own idea but in the QPT pattern i have hardly recognised
2 or 3 properties until now, and I am still trying to decrypt this hidden code of nature!
So any one who is interested to learn about this fascinating idea of QPT
can use this program freely and keep on updating me about some recognisable pattern
in this version of Quantum Periodic Table!
