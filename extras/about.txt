This program is developed by Master Shriraj Pramod Sawant (a.k.a. SR13),
as a part of his project of computer science for std XII.
This program is developed using Dev-C++ 5.5.3 on Windows 8.1 platform
and have used Window's Device Contexts(DC's) and other files like 'windows.h'
and hence compatible only on Windows OS versions.

This program is made by him not only as his project
but also to quench his curiosity of windows programming and use the most features of Standard C++ language, which is generally not even taught at high school level. ;P
Any one can use this program as a handy tool for chemistry under the 
agreement with the developer.
