## What is QPT?! ##

QPT is a Quantised version of the modern periodic table 
along with it's counter part the anti-periodic table 
(i.e a periodic table of anti-matter elements).

Quantised in the sense
that every element can be grouped in its certain orbital packet 
(s1,s2,p1,p2...or in case of anti we have alpha1,alpha2,beta1....etc).
This packets are named by the orbital name which is largest in its packet. 
Each packet comes with two versions for e.g d1 and d2. This table has
a unique incremental pattern, which can be computer generated till infinity.

The idea behind this project is to recognise this hidden pattern in this
elements of our nature and try to extract the information encrypted in this pattern.
Some of the names like(alpha, beta orbitals) are not IUPAC and are used only to
complete this project.

This project is my own idea but I am still trying to decrypt this hidden code of nature revealed apparently by my QPT!
So any one who is interested to learn about this fascinating idea of QPT
can use this program freely and keep on updating me about some recognisable pattern
in this version of Quantum Periodic Table!

## About ##

This program is developed by Master Shriraj Pramod Sawant (a.k.a. SR13),
as a part of his project of computer science for std XII.
This program is developed using Dev-C++ 5.5.3 on Windows 8.1 platform
and have used Window's Device Contexts(DC's) and other files like 'windows.h'
and hence compatible only on Windows OS versions.

This program is made by him not only as his project
but also to quench his curiosity of windows programming and use the most features of Standard C++ language, which is generally not even taught at high school level. ;P
Any one can use this program as a handy tool for chemistry under the 
agreement with the developer.

Note 1:- 
The console should be preconfigured for the Best experience with the following options:
Buffer size:-
Width: 160.
Height: 1000.

Window size:-
Width: 160.
Height: 50.

Window position:-
Left: 0.
Top: 0.

For Font:-
Font: Lucida Console.
Size: 14.

Note 2:- 
In latest windows OS versions, I have faced problems regarding mouse usage in console due to 'quick edit' and 'insert mode' of Command Prompt.
So for that, click the Top-Left corner of cmd, and click on properties, then under Edit options disable 'quick edit' and 'insert mode'.
